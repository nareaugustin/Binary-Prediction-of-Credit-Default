# Binary-Prediction-of-Credit-Default
This is a graduate level group project that was designed to apply logistic Lasso, Ridge , Elastic Net and Random forest to  binary classification problem, find the most important predictors, compare the cross validation curve, the time it to cross validate each  model and make a scientific judgement on the best model. We decided to model a binary credit default using some dataset found on Kaggle.com.  Our dataset contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the year 2007 - 2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.)and latest payment information. Our dataset contains total of 8,55,969 records with 73 features including target variable. Moreover, the dataset is very unbalanced, with approximately 6 % of loans considered as defaulted.
