# Binary-Prediction-of-Credit-Default
This is a master level group project that was designed to apply logistic Lasso, Ridge , Elastic Net and Random forest to  binary classification problem.  We were able to identify the most important independent variables based on each model. By comparing the cross validation curve, the time it to cross validate the model and the AUC, we identified the best model. The data was collected on Kaggle.com and our dependent variable is a binary credit default.  Our dataset contains complete loan data for all loans from 2007 to 2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.)and latest payment information. Our dataset contains total of 8,55,969 observations and 73 variables. The data was  is very unbalanced, with approximately 6 % of loans considered as defaulted.
